# Trademarks and branding

“Revamped GY”, “MMG Checkout for WooCommerce” (project name) and the Revamped GY logos are trademarks or brand identifiers owned by Revamped GY.

The code in this repository is licensed under GPL-2.0-or-later, but the licence does not grant rights to use our trademarks or branding in a way that suggests you are Revamped GY or that your product is an official Revamped GY release. This is separate from the code licence.

## You MAY
- Use the plugin for your own site or a client site, including commercial sites
- Share the unmodified source code under the GPL terms
- Fork the project and publish your own version if you rename it and remove Revamped GY branding
- Say “Built on MMG Checkout for WooCommerce by Revamped GY” or “Forked from Revamped GY” as accurate attribution

## You MAY NOT
- Sell, market, or distribute a build as if it is an official Revamped GY plugin
- Use the Revamped GY name or logos in a way that suggests endorsement, partnership, or that you are Revamped GY
- Create a confusingly similar brand, plugin name, or logo that could mislead users
- Offer separate services while pretending you are Revamped GY or acting as an official Revamped GY representative

## Official builds
Only builds released by Revamped GY are “official builds”. If you distribute your own build, you must rename the plugin and remove Revamped GY logos and brand styling that implies official status.

If you are unsure whether your usage is acceptable, open an issue or contact Revamped GY.
